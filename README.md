# TempoDB (Embedded) C Client

The [TempoDB](http://www.tempo-db.com) (Embedded) C API Client is intended for use with embedded electronics. It is designed to be lightweight and portable, and to address a variety of platforms. In the interest of targeting smaller devices, it provides a write-only subset of the API features you'd get from one of [our higher-level libraries](http://tempo-db.com/docs/clients/).

## Beta

This library is under active development, and we are looking for feedback. If you give this it a try, drop us a note (<tech@tempo-db.com>). Your experience will help us with continued development, and if you have problems, we may be able to help.
